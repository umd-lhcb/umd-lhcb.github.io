# UMD LHCb software index page on github.com [![Build status](https://travis-ci.com/umd-lhcb/umd-lhcb.github.io.svg?build)](https://travis-ci.com/umd-lhcb)
The `master` branch is a static webpage that is automatically generated by Travis CI.
The `build` branch provides actual Jekyll templates that generates `lhcb-umd.github.io`.

Edit the `index.md` to your liking.
After committing, push your changes to the same branch:
```
git push origin build
```

Wait for a couple of seconds as the Travis CI server automatically builds the page for you.

To build the page in your computer you will need `ruby`. It can be installed in the terminal (linux/macOS)
as follows
```
echo "gem: --no-document" >> ~/.gemrc
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --auto-dotfiles --autolibs=enable --rails
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Additionally, you will need to initialize the bootstrap submodule. This way we ensure that
we use the exact version that is needed. This module provides predefined CSS styles that
will work on a variety of browsers and screen resolutions.
```
git submodule update
```

You are now ready to build the website! Just type
```
jekyll serve
```
and open the website in your browser at [[http://127.0.0.1:4000][http://127.0.0.1:4000]]
