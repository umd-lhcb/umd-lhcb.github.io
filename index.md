title: UMD Flavor Changing and CP Violation group
---

The research group on Flavor Physics and CP violation at University of Maryland
is engaged in experimental studies of particles containing the bottom and charm
quarks, including the breaking of the CP invariance in the decays of these
particles. Precise measurements of these decay processes may help reveal
important information on the energy scale and the structure of new physics
beyond the Standard Model.

The group has had a long history of research in this areas since 1981, with the
CLEO experiment at Cornell , the OPAL experiment at the LEP collider at CERN,
the BaBar experiment at SLAC (1993-present) and the LHCb experiment at the LHC
collider at CERN (2012-present).

We are also heavily engaged in the design and development of the tracking
system for the upgrade of the LHCb detector.
