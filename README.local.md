# Build this website locally
This website is generated by `jekyll`, which is a `ruby` program. To build this
site locally, you need to install `ruby`.

We recommend install and manage `ruby` versions via `rvm`.  `rvm` (Ruby Version
Manager) is an established way of managing `ruby` and `ruby` packages (gems).

It can be installed in the terminal (linux/macOS) as follows:
```
echo "gem: --no-document" >> ~/.gemrc
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --auto-dotfiles --autolibs=enable --rails
```

`ruby` gems can be managed via `bundler`. To install:
```
gem install bundler
```

Now it's time to install `jekyll` and all its dependencies. Go to the root
directory of this project (you should see a `Gemfile` here):
```
bundle install
```

Additionally, you will need to initialize the `bootstrap` submodule. This way
we ensure that we use the exact version that is needed. This module provides
predefined CSS styles that will work on a variety of browsers and screen
resolutions.
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

You are now ready to build the website! Just type:
```
jekyll serve
```
This will build and launch a test web server. Open the website in your browser
at http://127.0.0.1:4000 to view the website.

If you just want to build, type in:
```
jekyll build
```
And the generated site will be located in `_site`.

Enjoy!
