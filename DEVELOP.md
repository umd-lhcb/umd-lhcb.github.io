# Develop this website locally
This website is generated by `jekyll`, which is a `ruby` program. To build this
site locally, you need to install `nix` with flake support.

Go into a nix shell that contains everything:
```
nix develop
```

Additionally, you will need to initialize the `bootstrap` submodule. This way
we ensure that we use the exact version that is needed. This module provides
predefined CSS styles that will work on a variety of browsers and screen
resolutions.
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

You are now ready to build the website! Just type:
```
jekyll serve
```
This will build and launch a test web server. Open the website in your browser
at http://127.0.0.1:4000 to view the website.

If you just want to build, type in:
```
jekyll build
```
And the generated site will be located in `_site`.

Enjoy!
