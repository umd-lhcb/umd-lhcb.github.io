title: LHCb group at the University of Maryland

Our research group is engaged in experimental studies of particles containing the bottom quarks,
including the breaking of the CP invariance in the decays of these particles. Precise measurements of these
decay processes may help reveal important information on the energy scale and the structure of new physics
beyond the Standard Model (SM).

The group has had a long history of research in this area since 1981, with the CLEO experiment at Cornell,
the OPAL experiment at the LEP collider at CERN, the BaBar experiment at SLAC (1993-present) and the LHCb
experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (2012-present).

Currently, our research focuses on the following areas:
* **CP violation** measurements such as $$B^+ \rightarrow K^+\pi^0$$ or blah that could help explain why
our Universe has so much more matter than anti-matter.
* Tests of **lepton flavor universality**, a fundamental assumption within the SM that states that the
interactions of all charged leptons (electrons, muons, and taus) differ only because of their different masses.
Currently, semitauonic $$B$$ decays such as $$B \rightarrow D^{(*)}\tau\nu_\tau$$ present a deviation with respect
to the SM predictions that is significant at the 3.8Ïƒ level, eliciting great interest in the particle physics community.
* The **readout electronics** for the new Upstream Tracker detector to be installed into LHCb during 2019 and 2020.
