title: UMD flavor physics and CP violation group
---

Our research group, led by Professors Jawahery and Franco Sevilla, is engaged
in experimental studies of particles containing bottom quarks, including
the breaking of the CP invariance in the decays of these particles. Precise
measurements of these decay processes may help reveal important information on
the energy scale and the structure of new physics beyond the Standard Model
(SM).

The group has had a long history of research in this area since 1981, with the
CLEO experiment at Cornell, the OPAL experiment at the LEP collider at CERN,
the BaBar experiment at SLAC (1993-present) and the LHCb experiment at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (2012-present).

Currently, our research focuses on the following areas:
* Tests of **lepton flavor universality**, a fundamental assumption within the
  SM that states that the interactions of all charged leptons (electrons,
  muons, and taus) differ only because of their different masses.  Currently,
  [semitauonic $B$ decays](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature22346) such as $B \to D^{(*)}\tau\nu_\tau$ present a
  deviation with respect to the SM predictions that is significant at the 3.8Ïƒ
  level, eliciting great interest in the particle physics community.
* **CP violation** measurements that may help explain why our universe has so much more matter than anti-matter.
  Currently focusing on $B^+ \to K^+\pi^0$ and $B^0 \to {K_S} ^0\pi^0$ decays, which could also help resolve
  the so-called $K\pi$ puzzle.
* The **readout electronics** for the new Upstream Tracker detector to be
  installed into LHCb during 2019 and 2020.
