# UMD LHCb software index page on github.com [![Build status](https://travis-ci.com/umd-lhcb/umd-lhcb.github.io.svg?build)](https://travis-ci.com/umd-lhcb)
The `master` branch is a static webpage that is automatically generated by Travis CI.
The `build` branch provides actual Jekyll templates that generates `lhcb-umd.github.io`.
The theme is based on `pages-themes/hackers`: [1].

Licensed under `CC0-1.0`, same as the original hackers theme.

## Build
To build, first checkout the `build` branch:
```
git fetch origin
git checkout -b build origin/build
```

Then edit the `index.md` to your likings.
After committing, push your changes to the same branch:
```
git push origin build
```

Wait for a couple of seconds as the Travis CI server automatically builds the page for you.
